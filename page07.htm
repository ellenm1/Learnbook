            <p><strong>Background on  Tuberculosis</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Tuberculosis (TB) </strong>is a disease caused by the bacterium, <em>Mycobacterium  tuberculosis. </em>In humans it usually causes a debilitating lung infection or  pneumonia that requires treatment with special antibiotic medications. If a  person with TB disease does not receive appropriate treatment, it can lead to  severe illness and death. </p>
            <p>TB was once the leading cause of death in  the United    States.<strong> </strong>With the discovery of anti-tuberculosis drugs beginning in 1945, the  incidence of TB in the US dropped sharply. From 2004-2008, 10 or  fewer patients with infectious TB were identified per year at the University of  Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers (UMHHC) and also in Washtenaw County. </p>
